# Changelog

Narrative history of significant changes to the Superpowers MM Plugin. Each entry describes what changed and why — not a per-commit log.

## 2026-04-15

Renamed the plugin repo from `superpowers-plugin` to `superpowers-MM-plugin` to make its identity as a montymerlinHQ-specific fork clearer. Added agentic scaffold (CLAUDE.md, CHANGELOG.md, DECISIONS.md, ROADMAP.md) to bring the repo up to agentic best practices.

Also added a ROADMAP item to explore workspace-specific customisation of the MM skills — the current skills are adapted for generic knowledge work but don't reference montymerlinHQ-specific structures (SOUL.md, STYLE.md, 6Rs pipeline, Ars Contexta, etc.). That's a future improvement tracked in ROADMAP.md.

## 2026-04-08 — v0.2.0

Synced with upstream Superpowers v5.0.7. Ported the CSO methodology, bulletproofing framework, and skill-type testing patterns into `writing-skills`. Added scope-decomposition and spec-saving steps to `brainstorming`. Tightened rationalization prevention in `verification-before-completion`. Added two new skills:

- **parallel-work** — adapted from upstream `dispatching-parallel-agents` for knowledge-work parallelization
- **executing-plans** — adapted from upstream with git/branch references removed

## 2026-04-03 — v0.1.0

Initial release. Ten skills adapted from Superpowers v5.0.x by Rollo Bryant. Core methodology (Iron Laws, verification gates, rationalization prevention) is shared with upstream; domain-specific content rewritten for creative, strategic, and business workflows rather than software development.
