  Use for non-code knowledge work when facing 2+ independent tasks, deliverables, or

  constraints. Triggers on "these are independent", "do these in parallel", "multiple
  deliverables", "batch these", "work on all of these", or when a plan contains tasks
  that don't depend on each other. Also applies when troubleshooting multiple unrelated
  problems simultaneously. Knowledge-work adaptation of upstream

# Parallel Work

Dispatch independent tasks to separate agents working concurrently. Instead of working through tasks sequentially, identify which ones are truly independent and run them in parallel — completing in the time of one instead of the time of many.

**Core principle:** Dispatch one agent per independent problem domain. Let them work concurrently. Review and integrate when they return.

## When to Use

```
Multiple tasks or deliverables?
  ├── yes → Are they independent (no shared inputs or dependencies)?
  │          ├── yes → Can agents work without interfering?
  │          │          ├── yes → PARALLEL DISPATCH
  │          │          └── no (shared resources) → Sequential agents
  │          └── no (related) → Single agent handles all
  └── no → Normal single-task execution
```

**Use when:**
- 3+ deliverables that don't depend on each other
- Multiple research threads across different domains
- Several independent problems to diagnose simultaneously
- Batch content creation where pieces don't reference each other
- Parallel audit or review of unrelated items

**Don't use when:**
- Tasks are related (output of one feeds into another)
- Need to maintain a consistent voice/thread across deliverables
- Tasks would reference the same evolving document
- You don't yet understand the scope (investigate first, parallelize later)

## The Pattern

### 1. Identify Independent Domains

Group tasks by what they touch. Each domain should be self-contained:
- Research on Topic A doesn't affect Research on Topic B
- Proposal Section 1 doesn't depend on Section 3
- Problem in Process X is unrelated to Problem in Process Y

### 2. Create Focused Agent Tasks

Each agent gets:
- **Specific scope:** One deliverable or investigation
- **Clear goal:** What "done" looks like
- **All context needed:** Don't assume the agent has your conversation history
- **Constraints:** What NOT to touch or change
- **Expected output:** What to return (summary, file, findings)

**Good agent prompt:**
```markdown
Research the current landscape of ecological credit registries in Southeast Asia.

Context: We're writing a market analysis for Bridging Worlds. The Southeast
Asia section is one of four regional sections being researched in parallel.

Scope: Southeast Asia only (Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia, Philippines,
Malaysia, Singapore, Cambodia, Myanmar, Laos).

Deliverable: A markdown file with:
- Active registries and their focus areas
- Volume of credits issued (last 12 months if available)
- Key projects and methodologies
- Emerging trends

Save to: research/bridging-worlds/references/2026-04-08_SEA-Credit-Registries.md

Do NOT cover other regions - those are being researched separately.
```

**Bad agent prompt:**
"Research ecological credits" — too broad, no constraints, no output format.

### 3. Dispatch in Parallel

Launch all independent agents simultaneously. Don't wait for one to finish before starting the next — that defeats the purpose.

### 4. Review and Integrate

When agents return:
1. **Read each result** — understand what was produced
2. **Check for conflicts** — did agents make contradictory assumptions?
3. **Verify quality** — run two-stage-review on each deliverable
4. **Integrate** — combine results, ensure consistency across the whole
5. **Fill gaps** — parallel work sometimes reveals gaps between domains

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---|---|
| Scope too broad ("handle everything") | One clear deliverable per agent |
| Missing context (agent doesn't know the project) | Include all necessary background in the prompt |
| No output format specified | Tell the agent exactly what to return |
| Dispatching related tasks in parallel | If Task B depends on Task A's output, run them sequentially |
| Skipping the integration step | Always review the combined output for consistency |

## Red Flags (Rationalization Prevention)

| You might think... | But actually... |
|---|---|
| "I'll just do these one at a time, it's easier" | Sequential work on independent tasks wastes time. Parallelize. |
| "These might be related" | If you can't name the specific dependency, they're independent. |
| "I'll parallelize later" | If tasks are independent NOW, dispatch NOW. |
| "One big agent can handle all of this" | Focused agents with narrow scope produce better results than one agent juggling everything. |

## Integration with Other Skills

- After **writing-plans**: scan the plan for independent tasks — candidates for parallel dispatch
- Each parallel agent should invoke **verification-before-completion** before returning
- After integration, run **two-stage-review** on the combined deliverable
