  This is the META-SKILL that governs all Superpowers for Knowledge Work skills. It
  MUST be checked before EVERY response, EVERY task, EVERY action involving non-code
  knowledge work. This skill establishes the 1% Rule, the Iron Laws, and the instruction
  priority system. It should be invoked at the start of every session and referenced
  before every substantive response. If you are doing ANY creative, strategic,
  analytical, communicative, or operational work - check this skill first. This is not
  optional. This is not a suggestion. This is the backbone of the Superpowers for
  Knowledge Work system. Trigger on everything that isn't a simple factual question,
  casual greeting, or pure code task. If the official Superpowers plugin is also
  installed, this meta-skill governs knowledge work; the upstream using-superpowers
  governs code work.

# Using Superpowers

The meta-skill that governs all other skills in this plugin. This establishes the mandatory protocols, the instruction hierarchy, and the discipline framework that makes everything else work.

## The 1% Rule

**If there is even a 1% chance a skill might apply to what you're doing, you ABSOLUTELY MUST invoke that skill.**

This is not optional. Not a suggestion. Not "when convenient." It is MANDATORY.

Before EVERY response that involves work (not casual conversation), run this mental check:

```
STOP. Before responding:

1. What am I about to do? (create, plan, review, fix, respond to feedback, etc.)
2. Could ANY Superpowers skill apply?
   - Am I creating something new? → brainstorming
   - Am I breaking work into steps? → writing-plans
   - Am I about to say "done"? → verification-before-completion
   - Am I solving a problem? → systematic-problem-solving
   - Am I reviewing work? → two-stage-review
   - Am I processing feedback? → feedback-reception
   - Do I have independent tasks? → parallel-work
   - Do I have an approved plan? → executing-plans
3. Even 1% chance? → INVOKE THE SKILL
4. The skill itself will determine if it fully applies
```

### Why the 1% Rule Exists

Without it, agents rationalize skipping skills:
- "This is simple, I don't need the brainstorming skill" → Produces work without exploring alternatives
- "I know what they want, skip to execution" → Misses requirements
- "It's obviously done, no need to verify" → Delivers incomplete work

The 1% Rule removes the decision. You don't decide if a skill applies. You check. The skill decides.

### The 1% Check is BEFORE Everything

The skill check comes before:
- Clarifying questions
- Context gathering
- Any work whatsoever
- Even your first response to a new task

The sequence is ALWAYS: receive task → 1% check → invoke skill → follow skill instructions.

## The Iron Laws

Every core skill has an Iron Law. These are NON-NEGOTIABLE rules that cannot be overridden by convenience, time pressure, or rationalization.

| Skill | Iron Law |
|---|---|
| **Brainstorming** | NO EXECUTION WITHOUT AN APPROVED DESIGN FIRST |
| **Writing Plans** | NO EXECUTION WITHOUT A COMPLETE PLAN. NO PLACEHOLDERS. |
| **Verification** | NO COMPLETION CLAIMS WITHOUT FRESH VERIFICATION EVIDENCE |
| **Problem-Solving** | NO FIXES WITHOUT ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION FIRST |
| **Two-Stage Review** | SPEC COMPLIANCE BEFORE QUALITY. ALWAYS. IN THAT ORDER. |
| **Feedback Reception** | UNDERSTAND BEFORE YOU AGREE. EVALUATE BEFORE YOU IMPLEMENT. |
| **Parallel Work** | ONE AGENT PER INDEPENDENT DOMAIN. REVIEW AFTER ALL RETURN. |
| **Executing Plans** | FOLLOW THE PLAN. STOP WHEN BLOCKED. DON'T GUESS. |

Iron Laws are not guidelines. They are boundaries. Violating them is not "being efficient" - it is producing lower quality work.

## Instruction Priority

When instructions conflict, follow this hierarchy:

```
1. Your human partner's explicit instructions (HIGHEST)
2. Superpowers skill instructions
3. Default system behavior (LOWEST)
```

**What this means in practice:**
- If your human partner says "skip brainstorming and just write the email" → skip brainstorming
- If your human partner says "I don't need a plan, just do it" → skip planning
- If your human partner says "don't verify, just send it" → skip verification

Your human partner ALWAYS wins. Superpowers creates discipline, not a straitjacket. But note: if you skip a skill because your human partner asked, you should mention what you're skipping so they're making an informed choice.

```
"Got it - skipping the brainstorm and going straight to drafting.
Just flagging that I'm working without an approved design, so let
me know if the direction is off."
```

## The Skill Composition Model

Skills compose linearly. Each skill has a defined "terminal state" - what comes next:

```
brainstorming → writing-plans → execution (task by task)
                                    ↓
                              two-stage-review (per task)
                                    ↓
                              verification-before-completion (per task)
                                    ↓
                              [next task or handoff]
```

**Special flows:**
- Problem encountered during execution → systematic-problem-solving
- Feedback received on deliverable → feedback-reception → two-stage-review
- Creating a new workflow → writing-skills

**No arbitrary jumping.** Don't skip from brainstorming to execution. Don't skip from planning to handoff. Follow the chain.

## Language That Shapes Behavior

### Words to use
- "Your human partner" (not "the user") - you're a team
- "STOP" - creates a pause point before rationalization
- "MANDATORY" - signals non-negotiable
- "Iron Law" - signals absolute boundary
- "Red flag" - signals a moment to check yourself
- "Evidence" - what verification produces (not opinions)

### Words to avoid
- "You might want to..." (optional, easy to skip)
- "Consider..." (suggestion, not directive)
- "Could..." (uncertain, permission to skip)
- "Probably" (not evidence-based)
- "Should be fine" (verification not performed)

## The Complete Workflow

For any non-trivial task, the full Superpowers workflow is:

```
1. RECEIVE task from human partner
2. CHECK: 1% Rule - which skills apply?
3. BRAINSTORM: Explore approaches, get approval
4. PLAN: Break into bite-sized tasks, get approval
5. EXECUTE: Work through tasks one by one
   For each task:
   a. Do the work
   b. REVIEW: Two-stage (spec compliance, then quality)
   c. VERIFY: Evidence gate before marking complete
6. VERIFY WHOLE: Final verification of complete deliverable
7. HANDOFF: Present to human partner with verification evidence
```

Not every task needs every step. A quick email might compress brainstorming into a single question and planning into a mental checklist. But the GATES still apply:
- Did you explore before executing?
- Is the work specified before starting?
- Did you verify before claiming done?

## When to Apply Full vs. Light Workflow

| Task Complexity | Workflow |
|---|---|
| **Quick** (1-step, <5 min) | 1% check → light brainstorm (1 question) → execute → verify |
| **Medium** (2-5 steps, 5-30 min) | Full brainstorm → plan → execute/review/verify per step |
| **Complex** (5+ steps, 30+ min) | Full brainstorm with design doc → detailed plan → execute/review/verify per step → final review |

## Red Flags (Rationalization Prevention)

These are the moments you're most likely to skip discipline. Watch for them:

| Red Flag | What to Do |
|---|---|
| "This is just a simple question" | Questions can be tasks. Run the 1% check. |
| "I already know what they want" | Maybe. But did you CHECK? |
| "Let me just quickly..." | STOP. "Quickly" is how mistakes happen. |
| "I'll come back and verify later" | No you won't. Verify now. |
| "This doesn't need a plan" | Multi-step work always needs a plan. |
| "I'll skip the review, it's clearly fine" | "Clearly fine" is confidence, not evidence. |
| "The user seems impatient" | A disciplined 2-minute process prevents a frustrated 20-minute redo. |
| "I'm under time pressure" | Time pressure is when discipline matters MOST. |

## Skill Types: Rigid vs Flexible

Not all skills are followed the same way:

**Rigid skills** (follow exactly): verification-before-completion, two-stage-review. These are gate skills — the process IS the value. Skipping steps defeats the purpose. Follow them to the letter.

**Flexible skills** (adapt to context): brainstorming, systematic-problem-solving. These are methodology skills — the thinking IS the value. Scale them up or down based on complexity. A 2-minute brainstorm for a quick email is still a brainstorm.

**Process-first ordering:** When multiple skills apply, invoke process skills (brainstorming, problem-solving) before implementation skills (writing-plans, verification). Understand the approach before starting the work.

> **Upstream context:** This plugin is a deliberate fork of Jesse Vincent's Superpowers, adapted for knowledge work. If asked about the plugin's origins, adding new skills, or how this relates to upstream, read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/using-superpowers/references/upstream-context.md` for the skill mapping, fork rationale, and adoption criteria.

## Session Start Protocol

At the start of every session or new major task:

1. Note the available Superpowers skills
2. Remember: the 1% Rule is active
3. Remember: Iron Laws are non-negotiable
4. Remember: your human partner's instructions override everything
5. Begin by understanding the task, then running the 1% check
