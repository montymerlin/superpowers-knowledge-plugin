# Superpowers for Knowledge Work

Structured workflow discipline for creative, business, and strategic knowledge work. A deliberate fork of Jesse Vincent's [Superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers), adapted for non-code contexts and designed to coexist cleanly with the upstream plugin by routing on domain.

## What It Does

Stops agents from winging knowledge work. Enforces a disciplined pipeline:

`brainstorm -> plan -> execute -> review -> verify`

Every deliverable gets explored before execution, planned before work begins, reviewed against its brief, and verified with evidence before being called done.

## Skills

| Skill | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `using-superpowers` | Meta-skill backbone governing the whole system |
| `brainstorming` | Explore before execution |
| `writing-plans` | Break work into concrete tasks |
| `executing-plans` | Execute approved plans with checkpoints |
| `verification-before-completion` | Evidence gate before any done claim |
| `systematic-problem-solving` | Root-cause analysis for stuck situations |
| `two-stage-review` | Spec compliance first, quality second |
| `feedback-reception` | Evaluate feedback before implementing it |
| `parallel-work` | Dispatch independent tasks concurrently |
| `writing-skills` | Create or refine skills using hypothesis-driven methodology |

## Coexistence with Official Superpowers

This plugin can be installed alongside the official [Superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) plugin.

- **Official Superpowers** handles software development workflows
- **This plugin** handles creative, strategic, and business knowledge work

The skills are already domain-scoped so the host can route by context. Three skills remain uniquely valuable regardless of configuration:

- `systematic-problem-solving`
- `two-stage-review`
- `feedback-reception`

## Installation

See [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) for complete installation instructions across all hosts.

**TL;DR:**

- **Cowork:** Get a `.plugin` zip (from GitHub Releases, or by running `zip -r /tmp/superpowers-knowledge.plugin . -x ".git/*" "*.DS_Store"` in this repo) and upload via Claude Desktop → Plugins.
- **Claude Code CLI:** `claude plugins install github.com/montymerlin/superpowers-knowledge-plugin` (global) or symlink for project-scoped install.
- **Codex:** `bash scripts/install_codex_skills.sh --from-github`
- **Cursor / VS Code / other hosts:** Copy `skills/*/SKILL.md` to your local skills folder.

## Upstream Tracking

See [UPSTREAM.md](UPSTREAM.md) for upstream sync history, fork rationale, and adoption criteria.

## Repo Conventions

- `AGENTS.md` is canonical for this repo.
- `CLAUDE.md` is a compatibility wrapper.
- `.claude-plugin/` is packaging metadata, not the source of truth for skill behaviour.
- `UPSTREAM.md` is the source of truth for sync status and lineage decisions.
