# Decisions

Architectural decisions for the Superpowers MM Plugin. Log significant choices here *before* implementing, using the format below.

---

## Decision 001 — Deliberate fork over mirror (2026-04-03)

**Context:** Superpowers upstream targets software development workflows. The montymerlinHQ use case is primarily creative, strategic, and business knowledge work — proposals, campaigns, research, strategy documents — where code-specific skills (TDD, git workflows, debugging) don't apply.

**Decision:** Maintain a deliberate fork, selectively adopting upstream methodology improvements while replacing code-specific content with knowledge-work equivalents.

**Consequences:** We stay current on methodology (Iron Laws, verification patterns, rationalization prevention) while keeping domain-specific content relevant. The cost is ongoing maintenance overhead from tracking upstream.

**Alternatives Considered:**
- *Mirror upstream exactly* — rejected. Too many code-specific skills that would confuse or not trigger in a knowledge-work context.
- *Wrapper plugin that extends upstream* — rejected. Skill precedence rules make this complex; cleaner to own the full skill set.

## Decision 002 — Adopted agentic scaffold (2026-04-15)

**Context:** The plugin repo lacked CLAUDE.md, CHANGELOG.md, and DECISIONS.md, making it harder for Claude Code to understand conventions and for the history to be legible.

**Decision:** Add the standard agentic scaffold (CLAUDE.md, CHANGELOG.md, DECISIONS.md) alongside the existing README.md and ROADMAP.md.

**Consequences:** The repo is now a first-class agentic workspace. Claude Code has explicit instructions for skill authoring, versioning, and upstream sync.

**Alternatives Considered:**
- *Leave as-is* — rejected. Without CLAUDE.md, conventions have to be re-explained each session.

## Decision 003 — Bundle upstream context as on-demand reference (2026-04-21)

**Context:** Cowork loads skill SKILL.md files but doesn't auto-load the plugin's CLAUDE.md, README.md, or UPSTREAM.md. The skills are self-contained methodology docs and work well at runtime — except when a user asks about the plugin's origins ("how does this relate to the real Superpowers?"), wants to add a new skill (needs to check upstream first), or questions the fork rationale. That context lives only in UPSTREAM.md and CLAUDE.md, which are invisible during Cowork invocation.

**Decision:** Add `skills/using-superpowers/references/upstream-context.md` with a condensed version of the skill mapping, fork rationale, adoption criteria, and new-skill checklist. Add a one-line pointer in `using-superpowers/SKILL.md` directing the agent to load it when relevant.

**Consequences:**
- The meta-skill can now answer origin questions and guide new skill creation without external docs
- Follows the same pattern established in agentic-scaffold Decision 008 (references for *why*, SKILL.md for *what*)
- Minor maintenance: upstream-context.md must be updated when UPSTREAM.md Sync Status table changes
- Patch bump (0.3.0 → 0.3.1) — no new skills, just a reference addition

**Alternatives Considered:**
- *Inline upstream context in using-superpowers SKILL.md* — rejected. Adds ~60 lines to a skill that's already the longest in the plugin, and the context is rarely needed
- *Leave as-is* — viable, since the gap is minor. But the cost of adding it is low and the pattern is already established

## Decision 004 — Dual-distribution packaging with marketplace.json (2026-04-21)

**Context:** The plugin was positioned as a "Claude Code plugin" in documentation, with no explicit Cowork install path or marketplace.json for `claude plugins install`. As the plugin portfolio standardised on dual-distribution (Claude Code CLI + Cowork desktop), this plugin was the only one without a marketplace listing or installation instructions for both hosts.

**Decision:** Add `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`, add a Distribution section to CLAUDE.md, and add installation instructions (Claude Code CLI, Cowork, Cursor) to README.md. Follow the pattern established by mdpowers and git-plugin.

**Consequences:**
- Users can install via `claude plugins install github.com/montymerlin/superpowers-MM-plugin`
- Cowork users can install via `.plugin` zip or marketplace
- Documentation no longer positions the plugin as single-host
- marketplace.json version must stay in sync with plugin.json on each release

**Alternatives Considered:**
- *Claude Code only* — rejected. The skills are pure markdown with no host-specific code; there's no reason to limit distribution
- *Cowork only* — rejected. Claude Code is the primary development environment where the plugin is also heavily used

## Decision 005 — Rename to superpowers-knowledge and design for coexistence (2026-04-21)

**Context:** The plugin was named `superpowers-cowork`, which implied it was "the Superpowers plugin for Cowork" rather than what it actually is — a knowledge-work adaptation that runs in any host. More critically, it could now be installed in Claude Code alongside the official Superpowers plugin by Jesse Vincent. Seven of our ten skills (brainstorming, writing-plans, executing-plans, verification-before-completion, using-superpowers, writing-skills, parallel-work) overlap with upstream equivalents. Without explicit domain scoping, the agent can't distinguish which to use when both are loaded.

**Decision:** Three changes:

1. **Rename plugin** from `superpowers-cowork` to `superpowers-knowledge` in plugin.json and marketplace.json. Clearly signals domain rather than host.
2. **Add Coexistence section** to CLAUDE.md and README explaining the relationship, skill categories (shared methodology vs knowledge-work originals), and domain routing rules.
3. **Update all 10 skill descriptions** to include domain-scoping language. The 7 shared methodology skills now say "for non-code knowledge work" and "if the official Superpowers plugin is also installed, prefer this skill for creative/strategic/business tasks; prefer upstream for code tasks." The 3 originals (systematic-problem-solving, two-stage-review, feedback-reception) now explicitly note they have no upstream equivalent and add unique value in any configuration.

**Consequences:**
- Clean coexistence: when both plugins are installed, the agent routes by domain (code → upstream, knowledge → this plugin)
- The 3 original skills provide clear unique value that doesn't conflict with upstream regardless of configuration
- Plugin is fully functional standalone — no dependency on official Superpowers
- Name change requires updating marketplace references, Cowork `.plugin` files, and any documentation that references `superpowers-cowork`

**Alternatives Considered:**
- *Slim to 3 unique skills only* — rejected. Removes the complete methodology pipeline for standalone use. Users who don't have official Superpowers would lose the brainstorm → plan → execute → review → verify chain.
- *Keep name as superpowers-cowork* — rejected. The name implies Cowork-specificity, which is incorrect, and doesn't signal the knowledge-work domain scoping that makes coexistence work.
- *Split into "core" and "full" packages* — rejected. Doubles maintenance for marginal benefit. Domain-scoped descriptions handle the disambiguation sufficiently.
- *Automated conflict detection* — deferred. Could add a hook that checks for official Superpowers at session start and adjusts behaviour. Premature for now; description-level routing is sufficient.
